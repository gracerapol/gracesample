  <h3>What we do..??</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
    Cyberdyne, the Japanese robotics company with the slightly suspicious name,
	has just gotten approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin 
	offering its HAL (Hybrid Assistive Limb) lower-body exoskeleton to users in the United 
	States through licensed medical facilities. HAL is essentially a walking robot that you strap 
	to your own legs; sensors attached to your leg muscles detect bioelectric signals sent from your
	brain to your muscles telling them to move, and then the exoskeleton powers up and assists, 
	enhancing your strength and stability.

The version of HAL that the FDA has approved is called HAL for Medical Use, and it's designed to<br>
 help people with lower limb disabilities get better at walking on their own. <br>
 There are other exoskeletons that help rehabilitate people through physical walking motions,<br>
 but HAL is unique in the way that it relies on a mixture of voluntary control and autonomous control,<br>
 using the wearer's own nervous system to signal the robot when and how to move. <br>
 According to Cyberdyne, this makes the rehabilitation process more effective, <br>
 because it's not just the robot moving— it's you.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>What is HAL.?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
    This is not to say that HAL is just some mindless leg moving machine. In fact, it's the opposite. <br>
	HAL pays close attention to your muscle movements and can actually sense how much muscle you're <br>
	planning to apply, and it calculates how much power to add and moves its motors before your muscles <br>
	move on their own. This means that that you still have complete control over when you take a step,<br>
	where you take a step, and the length and height of your stride. When you get the hang of it, which<br>
	took me barely five minutes,<br>
	it's really just like walking, except using robot muscles instead of your own.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>How comfartable is HAL</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
    After a few trips up and down the stairs and some more walking around, <br>
	I'm feeling totally comfortable in HAL. The suit supports its own weight, <br>
	so it effectively weighs nothing when you have it on, and when you stop trying to walk<br>
	with your legs and let the suit move them for you, the entire experience becomes virtually<br>
	seamless. And then just when I'm starting to relax, it's time to sit down and take the suit off.<br>
	I'm incredibly sad as HAL powers down and returns to its limp, dead robot look...<br>
	I was only in it for ten minutes, but it already feels a little bit like a part of me.
    </p>

      <li>Armor</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h3>How we help in disabilities.?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
    Since many lower limb disabilities are caused by disconnects between what the brain wants <br>
	to do, instructions that the nervous system transmits, and the resulting muscle movements,<br>
	HAL is intended to actively help users re-form those connections. Even if your muscles aren't <br>
	responding properly when your brain signals them to “walk,” having HAL intercept those signals <br>
	and move your muscles for you can accelerate the learning process by which your brain and muscles<br>
	figure out how to work together again. Cyberdyne calls this process “an interactive biofeedback loop,<br>
	” and says that “this repeated movement strengthens and adjusts the connections between the neurons in the brain and spinal cord and the connections between the neurons and muscles, <br>
	promoting improvement and regeneration of physical functions.”
    </p>
    <p>
    Cyberdyne's HAL (Hybrid Assistive Limb) exoskeleton is designed to augment the strength of the <br>
	wearer bya factor of up to ten. The suit senses when you want to move your legs, <br>
	and then it moves them for you, supporting both its weight and yours as it walks around with <br>
	you in it.
